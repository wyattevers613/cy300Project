Rules of Game:
- (Current) Asteroids fall down towards the player (the cannon). The player rotates using the left and
right arrow keys and shoots projectiles with the spacebar. When a projectile makes contact,
with an asteroid, the asteroid is destroyed.

- (Endstate) The player begins a new game from the menu. The game begins on Day 1. Asteroids begin to fall, and the
player (the cannon), rotates using the left and right arrow keys and fires projectiles with the spacebar. When a projectile
hits an asteroid, the asteroid explodes and the player's score goes up. At the conclusion of each day (a set time limit),
the player will recieve a certain amount of upgrade points to spend in the shop. These upgrades enhance the player's
ability to destroy astereoids effectively. If asteroids are not destroyed before they hit the ground, the player loses health. 
If the player's health reaches zero, they will receive a Game Over message and be returned to the menu. Here, the player can start
another run, keeping all of their old upgrades. At any time, the player can choose to save and quit the game to return later.
